# RTL_to_GDSII

This repository will contain tools and scripts to convert RTL designs into GDSII layouts. Adding this README makes the repository non-empty so you can create a Codespace.

## Quickstart

1. Open the repository on GitHub and click the "Code" button, then the "Open with Codespaces" tab, and create a new codespace.
2. Inside the Codespace you can run and develop the conversion tools.

## Repository layout

- docs/ - documentation and design notes
- src/ - source scripts and tools
- examples/ - example RTL and generated outputs

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or pull requests. If you need help setting up a Codespace, add a comment on an issue.
